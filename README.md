# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Modeling the effects of treating diabetic wounds with engineered skin substitutes.**   
Waugh HV, Sherratt JA. _Wound Repair Regen_ 2007 Jul-Aug;15(4):556-65
[17650100](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17650100) ,  
**Abstract:**   
In this paper, a novel mathematical model of wound healing in both normal and
diabetic cases is presented, focusing upon the effects of adding two currently
available commercial engineered skin substitute therapies to the wound
(Apligraf) and Dermagraft). Our work extends a previously developed model,
which considers inflammatory and repair macrophage dynamics in normal and
diabetic wound healing. Here, we extend the model to include equations for
platelet-derived growth factor concentration, fibroblast density, collagen
density, and hyaluronan concentration. This enables us to examine the
variation of these components in both normal and diabetic wound healing cases,
and to model the treatment protocols of these therapies. Within the context of
our model, we find that the key component to successful healing in diabetic
wounds is hyaluronan and that the therapies work by increasing the amount of
hyaluronan available in the wound environment. The time-to-healing results
correlate with those observed in clinical trials and the model goes some way
to establishing an understanding of why diabetic wounds do not heal, and how
these treatments affect the diabetic wound environment to promote wound
closure.
